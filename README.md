Artificial Intelligence Adoption in E-Commerce Enterprises: Analysis and Detection of Fake Reviews Using LIWC Corpus and Machine Learning Algorithms


Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify fake e-commerce reviews by combining LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) analysis with machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the reliability of online feedback platforms and improve trust in e-commerce systems by distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent reviews.

Features
